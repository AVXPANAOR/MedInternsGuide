# Medical Internship Survival Guide

## Introduction

### Rationale
The internship period can be tough and challenging. The journey truly begins with the realization that you are ultimately responsible for your own education. Alongside this daunting task, interns frequently encounter complex and sometimes uncomfortable interpersonal situations involving attendings, residents, peers, and patients, which can be difficult to navigate. Based on personal experience, an approach rooted in curiosity, responsibility, and compassion can be beneficial in managing these challenges. Although interns may not enjoy much free time, their legal immunity and the reduced emphasis on exams and scores allow for a more flexible learning experience. This gives you the opportunity to explore what truly seems useful and to learn in a manner that aligns with your preferred style. By exercising your autonomy and independence to select from a variety of learning resources, you can enhance your emotional engagement in the learning process, making the entire experience more rewarding, and less tedious.

### What Is This Guide About?
This guide aims to introduce alternative resources that the author found useful during their internship, along with instructions on how to access them. The goal is to provide you with a head start on your independent learning journey. Additionally, some general tips regarding personal well-being and interpersonal interactions will be shared to help you maintain your sanity during this challenging and stressful period.

### Who Is This Guide For?
While this guide is primarily written for Iranian junior interns looking to develop their clinical skills and knowledge, other clinicians—including junior medical students, residents, and general practitioners—may also find the discussed materials of interest.

**Note:** This guide is not suitable for preparing for residency exams. If you are planning to take the exam soon, this guide may not be for you.

## Resources

### How to Access These Resources?

* **[Library Genesis](https://libgen.li)**: A collaboratively run shadow library project that provides access to articles and books. It has an excellent archive, but download speeds are relatively slow. If it's unavailable, check their Wikipedia page for updated working domains.
  
* **[Anna's Archive](https://annas-archive.org)**: The largest archive among these options, but it also has slow download speeds.
  
* **[Z-library](https://z-library.sk)**: A more limited archive with excellent download speeds. It allows you to create your own Telegram bot. If it's unavailable, check their Wikipedia page for updated working domains.
  
* **[Ebookrally](https://ebookrally.ir)**: Allows you to purchase selected ebooks that you can't find for free.

You are neither expected nor able to memorize every single detail required to diagnose and manage every single pathology, but you are required to practice in accordance with the latest high-quality evidence. These two apps/websites allow you to find reliable answers to your clinical questions quickly. Get comfortable with them and learn to use them effectively and quickly.

* **[UpToDate](https://wolterskluwer.com/en/solutions/uptodate)**: It's a __must-have.__ It's a subscription-based service that provides you with all the relevant information, management algorithms, drug interaction checking service, etc. Basically, everything you need to navigate through a clinical situation. Many websites allow you to purchase a subscription; simply Google it in Farsi. It's also available on iMD. **Note:** Because of the insecure internet access condition in Iran, you are strongly advised to also subscribe to UpToDate's offline service.
* **[Medscape](https://medscape.com)**: The free alternative to UpToDate. The entries are significantly more concise and limited.
* **[MDCalc](https://mdcalc.com)**: An extremely handy tool for calculating clinical scores based on different criteria, and various other clinically relevant measures.

## Life During Internship
### Mental Health and Sleep
Internship is tough, and you are not Superman, or constantly on coke-I hope. You, like many of us, may fall prey to burnout, anxiety, mood disorders, and various psychiatric disorders. Always take adequate rest when you can. Prioritize your well-being. Immerse yourself as much as possible in things that keep you happy. Focus on what gives meaning to your life. Hold tight onto your hobbies. Socialize when you can. During this period, you're going to encounter some disturbing situations. Patients die. Mistakes are made. Conflicts arise. These are all part of the job. Take your time to process your feelings, talk about them, and move on. If you're too tired to do anything, it's alright, and there's no shame to it. If you're not feeling OK, don't be afraid to ask for help. Your psychiatry attendings are there for you in case you ever need professional help.

The internship period is short; try your best, but accept that you can't learn everything there is to medicine. No matter how hard you try, you will never be a perfect, infallible physician. Remind yourself that learning doesn't end with graduation. You have a lifetime of learning ahead of you. It takes a lot of responsibility and dedication to pull all your strength together to learn as much as you can, but always remember that [people's meat is physicians' poison](https://youtu.be/c-5EcSBT_hM?si=xFnRB1G90HdaHcvp). An imperfect physician is surely better than a perfect but dead one.

Adequate sleep is crucial to mental well-being. Educate yourself about shift work sleep disorder and relevant conditions. Use those tips to optimize your sleep duration and quality.

**Note:** Never take a psychotropic medication on your own, no matter if you're a junior medical student or a seasoned psychiatrist; always consult another professional.

### Interpersonal Relationships and Abuse
Studies show non-traumatic stressful events, such as
Poor role modeling and mistreatment by superiors are associated with increased anxiety scores and are suggested to decrease personal well-being in medical students. Interestingly, the number of direct trauma exposures, such as stressful patient-student interactions, is not significantly associated with long-term personal distress. This suggests that while students may become accustomed to working in a medical environment, the attitudes and behaviors of those supervising them may be more important in their well-being. Stand in solidarity against abusing seniors. No one has the right to verbally or physically abuse you. At the same time, don't take these encounters personally. Always remember that every relationship is a mixture of transferential and real qualities. Also, never forget that being mistreated does not give you permission to mistreat others. Be kind and supportive toward the junior and fellow trainees.

**Note:** Here's a very brief [source-book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eaIRL47zDmEmQUJHDNKe20rTDWsjzDs8/view?usp=sharing) that we curated to defend a resident's case against abusing senior residents and attendings. You might find some of these citations useful for backing up your statements in similar cases. 

### Minorities and Marginalized Groups
Going through medical school as a minority feels like competing in a marathon while carrying an invisible boulder. You are seen and your struggle is valid, but remember that you're probably neither the first nor the last minority person who has been through this, and it is ultimately up to you to make something useful out of your struggle. Think of the unique perspective that being a minority has bestowed upon you, how it has enhanced your ability to empathize with different people. Our suffering ultimately becomes a toolbox with which we can help ourselves and others, but only if we allow it. Live your life. Be yourself. Be proud. But never forget that you also must protect yourself from other people. Not everyone is accepting of you, but you also don't need everyone's acceptance. Focus on the safe people who are closer to you. Those are the ones who truly matter.

### Olympiads and Competitions
The clinical reasoning olympiad can be an effective tool to boost your motivation for learning. Study in groups and debate the problems. Try to have fun with it as much as you can. If your efforts lead to a medal, then kudos to you; if not, then there's nothing personal. You learned a lot, and had fun doing it; that's the only thing that truly matters.
